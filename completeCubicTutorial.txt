Run Cubic
Select a directory to store all data
Select the ubuntu iso you desire
Under the "Custom Disk..." column (right-side column), do the following:
	In the "Filename" field, delete "ubuntu-" and add "advantech-" (ie my final result was "advantech-20.04.6-2023.04.17-desktop-amd64.iso")
	In the "Disk Name" field, add "Advantech-" in front of everything (ie my final result was Advantech-Ubuntu 20.04.6 2023.04.17 LTS "Custom Focal Fossa")
Once in the virtual environment, copy the following commands EXACTLY:

mkdir /etc/skel/.config/
mkdir /etc/skel/.config/autostart/
apt update
apt install gcc
nano /etc/skel/CarrierTest.sh

***copy contents of CarrierTestScriptForCubic.sh***

nano /etc/skel/program.c

***copy contents of c-programForCubicIso.txt***

nano /etc/skel/.config/autostart/program.desktop

***copy contents of desktopApplicationSourceCode.txt***

chmod +x /etc/skel/CarrierTest.sh 
chmod +x /etc/skel/program.c 
chown root /etc/skel/CarrierTest.sh 
chmod 4755 /etc/skel/CarrierTest.sh 
cd /etc/skel/
gcc program.c -o program
chmod +x program
chown root.root program
chmod 4755 program
cd ..
cd ..   
cd ~
nano /etc/skel/.config/autostart/program.desktop
chmod +x /etc/skel/.config/autostart/program.desktop 
chown root /etc/skel/.config/autostart/program.desktop 
chmod 4755 /etc/skel/.config/autostart/program.desktop
nano /etc/netplan/01-network-manager-all.yaml ***copy following***
			
# Let NetworkManager manage all devices on this system

Hit "Next" button to exit virtual environment
Unless you want to mess with installed/uninstalled packages, I would recommend just hitting "Next" button again
Hit "Next" button
I would stick with the default compression which is .gzip
Hit generate button
Once everything is done, copy the newly created iso to a USB stick
Plug USB stick into a machine with Windows on it
Copy iso from USB stick to somewhere on the machine
Use Rufus to burn the iso onto a different USB stick (do GPT scheme with NTFS file system)
Take the burned USB stick and plug it into a machine with Linux on it
Run Gparted
In top right corner, select the /dev that your USB is (if you are unsure just look at the GB size)
Right click on the main partition and NTFS partition and unmount both
Right click on main partition and select the "Resize/Move" option
In the "Free Space Preceding" field, type anywhere from 1000-5000 and press enter button
Click the "Resize/Move" button
In the newly created space (labeled "unallocated"), right click and select the "New" option
Leave everything default, but change the file system field to fat32
Under the top menu, there will be a green checkmark; you MUST click this to apply the partition changes
Click green check mark and wait for changes to take place (can take anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour and a half so get comfy)
Voila
